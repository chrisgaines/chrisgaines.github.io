		<h3>About</h3>
		
			<p class="top-0">
			
				Beginning at the ripe age of thirteen I unknowingly began working towards
				being an IT professional by managing my family's computer and routers,
				even re-creating the famous game Connect Four in a programming class in high school.
				As I continued my education at The Florida State University I was introduced to programming
				languages such as PHP, Java, JavaScript and SQL, allowing me to combine everything that I've
				learned throughout my life to create some neat applications. Some of these can be found under my
				Experience or Portfolio sections of my site.

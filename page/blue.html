				Hi my name is Chris. I am an applications developer that currently works for a start up in Daytona Beach, Florida. I enjoy building world class applications utilizing technologies such as Laravel, Angular, Ionic, Vue.js, and Git. In my spare time I tend to obssess over sports and the stats that come with them and work on creating the perfect beer from scratch in my garage.
				
				<!-- Beginning at the ripe age of thirteen I unknowingly began working towards being an IT professional by managing my family's computer and routers, even re-creating the famous game Connect Four in a programming class in high school. As I continued my education at The Florida State University I was introduced to programming languages such as PHP, Java, JavaScript and SQL, allowing me to combine everything that I've learned throughout my life to create some neat applications. Some of these can be found under my Experience or Portfolio sections of my site. -->
